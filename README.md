#DayZ n Chill's Glowing Zombies Eyes
##About The Mod!
I created this mod because I always loved the way the eyes glow in the Call of Duty series Zombies. So to simulate that effect I have created the DayZ Emissive Zombies. Note this mod is a work in progress.

##Instructions:

NOTE: The rvmats are locating in the pbo on the workshop NOT IN THIS REPO. You will have to unpack and repack to change brightness or add your own colors.

You can easily change the colors of the eyes by editing one line of code in the eyes.rvmat
Just open the file in any text editor and go to line 4:
Look for the code that looks like the line below.

emmisive[] = {15,15,0,1};

VALUES = R,B,G,A (Red, Blue, Green, Alpha)
1 = 10%

You can go over 100% to gain brightness, but may make your zombies bodies glow slightly.
I will be tweaking the rvmats to fix this over time.

##XML
XML Files included in mod.

##Can I Repack?
This was a very simple mod. You can repack it, reuse it, do what ever you want with it. I hope you all enjoy it.
A little credit would be nice. :)

##Support
If you need help with this you can find me on discord at discord.gg/dayznchill
